* About spacenav
  This is a Common Lisp binding to libspnav and for using 3D mice compatible with [[http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/][spacenav]].

* Requirements
  This package requires libspnav to be in the library path.  On Debian it can be installed with:
  #+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get install libspnav0
  #+end_src

* Using

** Debugging
   This snippet shows how to view 3D mouse events for debugging:

#+name: event-debug
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :spacenav)
  (spacenav:debug-events)
#+end_src


** Event loop
   This example shows a simple event loop:

#+name: simple-event-loop
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :spacenav)
  (defun 3d-mouse-event-loop ()
    "Loop until button one is released."
    (unwind-protect
         (let ((res (sn:sn-open)))
           (format t "Device name: ~s~%" (sn:device-name))
           (format t "Device type: ~a~%" (sn:device-type))
           (format t "Device buttons: ~d~%" (sn:device-buttons))
           (format t "Device axes: ~d~%" (sn:device-axes))
           (format t "Device USBID: ~s~%" (sn:device-usbid))

           (when res
             (loop
               for event = (sn:wait-event)
               do (print event)
               while (and event
                          (not (sn:button-release-p event 1))))))
      (sn:sn-close)))
  (3d-mouse-event-loop)
#+end_src
