  (spacenav:debug-events)
#+end_src


** Event loop

#+name: simple-event-loop
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :spacenav)
  (defun mouse-event-loop ()
    "Loop until button one is released."
    (unwind-protect
         (let ((res (spacenav:sn-open)))
           (when res
             (loop
               for event = (spacenav:wait-event)
               do (print event)
               while (and event
                          (not (button-release-p event 1)))
               do
                  (handle-mouse-event event))))
